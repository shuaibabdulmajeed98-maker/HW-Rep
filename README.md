The purpose of this repo is to display the name of the collaborators using python as requested by Miss De Fritas.

The steps taken to complete the tutorial were as follows:
  + Firstly I logged into the GitHub website and then downloaded the software on my computer
  + After exploring the software I watched videos on how to create a local repo
  + Watched more videos on how to commit the repo, add files and push the branches with the files to GitHub
  + I then has a study session with a few classmates to discuss how to do pull requests and the finalizing of the instructions given for the assignment

The collaboraters are:
Shuaib Abdul-Majeed & Unique Parris
